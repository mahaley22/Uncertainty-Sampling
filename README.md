This notebook trains a sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model for machine translation, using Attention. However, instead of looking at the Attention plots, we will be looking at a whole lot of Uncertainty plots and aggregating by uncertainty to reveal some directions for analyzing avoidable bias, variance, and sampling for Active Learning.
