 It's just something i tacked on to the outputs ("logits") of the final layer as an implementation detail. The original code just spat out the raw scores, so my applying softmax after optimization does not change the individual tokens ranking. 

However,  let's say you want to rank and find the "most uncertain" outputs (sentences)  for human review.   Interestingly enough, using a custom softmax, or using a the first or second bar chart instead of the 3rd combination as I do in the notebook, *can* change the overall uncertainty rankings of multiple outputs.    That Munro book I cite at the top of the nb emphasizes that there's nothing probabilistic or magical about softmax for this purpose, but its especially useful for uncertainty when softmax is not originally used as part of the optimization of the final layer .  That all the scores add up to 1 leads some to that "probabilistic" confusion, but it doesn't matter.

I'm not necessarily breaking new ground here for using uncertainty in MT or ML, but I've never yet seen an implementation that "paints a picture" for practitioners in industry, maybe just another widget in their toolkit to bear in mind as we consider more things  than raw accuracy or throughput or computational cost.
